# stack
Implementation of the videogame “STACK” 3D using python and a primary graphics library
Objective of the game: stack the biggest amount of boxes in a tower. The user has to press any key in order to stop the box. If the box is stopped out of the tower, the game is over. If the box is stopped over the tower but not in the exact place, the box gets sliced. The game gets faster and the box gets smaller.
